First day on NU campus; Meeting with Pravin about PVA and AFP III
project.</h4>
<p>Meeting notes</p>
<ul>
<li>PVA use as an ice recrystallization inhibitor</li>
<li>Sugar cosolutes: sucrose, glucose, trehalose
<ul>
<li>Although weak themselves, sugars can enhance ice recrystallization
inhibitors</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Goal of avoiding ice crystal conglomeration during freezing</li>
<li>Formation of semi-rigid hydration layers by PVA between forming ice
crystals, want to further investigate the mechanism/interaction between
PVA with water that inhibits the conglomeration of larger ice crystals
from forming</li>
<li>Showed data supporting evidence of different thermal hysteresis
between different AFP III mutants, potential (inadvertent?)
structure/function effects due to cysteine mutagenesis for spin-labeling
purposes</li>
<li>PVA in water forms hydrogels following a freeze-thaw cycle</li>
<li>6 cycles of freeze-thaw show an independence of concentration in gel
formation (?), gel porosity has dependence on concentration</li>
<li>Using 17O NMR chemical shifts to detect the extent of tetrahedral
“semi-rigid” hydration layer formation between PVA and forming ice
crystals</li>
<li>Tracking PVA mobility in solution pre- and post-freezing of PVA-H2O
solutions during ice crystallization</li>
<li>Imaging of ice crystal size/conglomeration using microscopy (new
microscope)
<ul>
<li>Told about freeze-thawing cycle on a microscope slide to view ice
recrystallization and its potential inhibition</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>after many failures, learned issue with autoclave had to do with
following written protocol (out-of-date) and intended/outdated procedure
(still not fully written out), just use ‘Liquid 30’ cycle, no ‘Dry 30’
equilvalent as far as I’m aware for this autoclave (autoclave 1 and 2 on
4th floor)</li>
<li>Installed SE521 software for datalogger, TestLink app on phone for
bluetooth moitoring capabilities of datalogger</li>
<li>Learning how to change datalogger settings, less active monitoring
to save some battery life
<ul>
<li>start run for comparison of 3 K type probes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Inoculated with GB1 cell stocks from -80 freezer (wt and N8C)
<ul>
<li>Miscommunications with Pravin (Learned on 8/15 after starting
expression over):
<ul>
<li>GB1 AFP III wt stock (and all GB1 stocks) have Kanamycin resistance
(not Ampicillin)</li>
<li>AFP III wt stock (not GB1) has Amp resistance</li>
</ul></li>
<li>for both Amp and Kan stocks; 1 M was too concentrated for both, Amp
also doesn’t have great solubility in 100% ethanol</li>
<li>Instead; made both Amp and Kan stocks to 1000X concentrations (“1X”
= 125 <span class="math inline"><em>μ</em></span>g/mL for Amp, = 50
<span class="math inline"><em>μ</em></span>g/mL for Kan) an dmade both
