First day on NU campus; Meeting with Pravin about PVA and AFP III
project.</h4>
<p>Meeting notes</p>
<ul>
<li>PVA use as an ice recrystallization inhibitor</li>
<li>Sugar cosolutes: sucrose, glucose, trehalose o Although weak
themselves, sugars can enhance ice recrystallization inhibitors</li>
<li>Goal of avoiding ice crystal conglomeration during freezing</li>
<li>Formation of semi-rigid hydration layers by PVA between forming ice
crystals, want to further investigate the mechanism/interaction between
PVA with water that inhibits the conglomeration of larger ice crystals
from forming</li>
<li>Showed data supporting evidence of different thermal hysteresis
between different AFP III mutants, potential (inadvertent?)
structure/function effects due to cysteine mutagenesis for spin-labeling
purposes</li>
<li>PVA in water forms hydrogels following a freeze-thaw cycle</li>
<li>6 cycles of freeze-thaw show an independence of concentration in gel
formation (?), gel porosity has dependence on concentration</li>
<li>Using 17O NMR chemical shifts to detect the extent of tetrahedral
“semi-rigid” hydration layer formation between PVA and forming ice
crystals</li>
<li>Tracking PVA mobility in solution pre- and post-freezing of PVA-H2O
solutions during ice crystallization</li>
<li>Imaging of ice crystal size/conglomeration using microscopy (new
microscope) o Told about freeze-thawing cycle on a microscope slide to
view ice recrystallization and its potential inhibition</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="section">7/9/2025:</h4>
<ul>
<li>talked more with Pravin about AFPs and project, sent folder of AFP
references to start reviewing.</li>
<li>Background research on AFP types, particularly type III, and their
functions in living organisms.</li>
</ul>
