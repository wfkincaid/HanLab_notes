# Introduction:

- Define PVA hydrogels
	- physical cross-linking method using F-T cycle and effect on hydrogel structure
- beneficial qualities, potential uses
- use of cosolutes



# Materials and Methods:

- different PVA MWs, selection of cosolutes
- protocol and composition (HEPES buffer if also including AFP)
- Freeze-thaw cycles and their annealing temperatures with respect to PVA concentration 
- Freeze-thaw cycle parameters for microscope/THMS600
	- Protocol for sample preparation on cover slips
- methods for hydrogel characterization
	- microscope

# Results:

- TH activities for different PVA percentages and varying cosolutes
- splat assay pictures of ice crystal size/growth/inhibition
- Rheology images 
- 17O measurements
- PFG-NMR, diffusivity
