## AFP III Expression

### "Day 1" 
- Can be split into 2 days 
#### Media Prep -
<u>Small Culture</u>
- LB Media:
	- Use at 25 g LB Miller Broth / 1 L H$_2$O
	- typically make 20 mL volume small cultures in 125 mL Erlenmeyer flasks, this would require 0.5 g LB Broth Miller 
	- Cover tops of flasks with aluminum foil, apply autoclave tape to secure foil
	- Autoclave; Liquid 30 cycle - must reserve in advance!

<u>Large Culture</u>
- LB Media or M9 Media:

- For LB Media LCs:
	- same as SC, use at 25 g LB Miller Broth / 1 L H$_2$O
	- If we perform an expression with LB media LCs, we will most commonly use LC of 500 mL volumes
	- Cover tops of flasks with aluminum foil, apply autoclave tape to secure foil
	- Autoclave; Liquid 30 cycle - must reserve in advance!
	- 1 M MgSO$_4$:
		- 0.602 g MgSO$_4$ in 5 mL H$_2$O
		- need 1 mL per 500 mL LC
	- 20 % Glucose:
		- 2.00 g glucose in 10 mL H$_2$O
		- need 8.75 mL per 500 mL LC

- For M9 Media LCs:
	- 10X M9 salts buffer:
			- 500 mM Na$_2$HPO$_4$
			- 200 mM KH$_2$PO$_4$
			- 90 mM NaCl
		- Make 1000 mL; 134.035 g Na$_2$HPO$_4$, 27.218 g KH$_2$PO$_4$, 5.2596 g NaCl
			- Weigh each of these out directly into a large beaker with a stirbar
			- Must be attentive, mass by subtraction
			- Once all 3 in beaker, add ~ 800 mL H$_2$0 SLOWLY while swirling beaker
			- Cover beaker with aluminum foil, place on stir plate with low heat and low stir speed
				- stir bar may not spin at first, this is okay, monitor until powders all dissolve
			- Balance pH to 7.4 - 7.5, calibrate probe if needed
				- Be sure to rinse probe and put back in holder securely
			- Transfer buffer solution into 1 L graduated cylinder to fill to 1000 mL
				- be careful to not transfer stir bar into graduated cylinder or buffer bottle
			- Pour back into 1 L beaker, filter buffer solution using Nalgene with Sartorius cellulose filter setup into an autoclaved 1000 mL borosilicate buffer bottle
			- Be sure to label bottle!
	- For M9 Media LCs
		- Commonly use 1000 mL LC; be sure to use the large (2800 mL) Fernbach flask
		- Mix 100 mL of premade 10X M9 salts buffer with 900 mL H$_2$O
		- Cover top with aluminum foil, apply autoclave tape to secure foil
		- Autoclave; Liquid 30 cycle - reservation necessary!
	
	- 2 M MgSO$_4$:
		- 12.037 g MgSO$_4$
		- Dissolve with filtered H$_2$0 in 50 mL falcon tube
		- MgSO$_4$ is exothermic (releases heat), add water slowly
		- vortex and label
	
	- 1 M CaCl$_2$:
		- 5.549 g CaCl$_2$
		- Dissolve with filtered H$_2$0 in 50 mL falcon tube
		- vortex and label

	- 1000X antibiotic stocks:
		- AFP III wt is encoded with ampicillin resistance
		- GB1 tagged AFP III wt and mutants are all encoded with kanamycin resistance
		- These stocks go bad rather quickly, store them in the fridge and make minimal amounts at a time (1-2 expressions worth)
		- For Kan: "1000X" = 50 mg/mL, make in 15 mL falcon tube
			- 250 mg in 5 mL H$_2$O
			- vortex to dissolve, label
		- For Amp: "1000X" = 125 mg/mL, make in 15 mL falcon tube
			- 625 mg in 5 mL H$_2$O
			- vortex to dissolve, label



#### Inoculate SCs, start expression (DO AFTER 5 pm)
- Make sure SCs are cooled after autoclaving if done on the same day
- Make sure to have an available incubator set to 37 $^o$C, shaking at 200 rpm
- Also make sure to swap in/out flask holders that fit the relevant flask being used

- In a sterile environment:
	- Add 20 $\mu$L of respective 1000X antibiotic solution, swirl solution to combine
	- Using a pipette tip, scoop a small amount from the glycerol stock of your current intended mutant for that culture in the expression
	- Drop tip with bacterial culture directly into flask
	- Recover with foil lid, place in incubator and leave to grow overnight. Don't leave i incubator > 16 hrs 
### "Day 2" 
- remove SCs from incubator, leave on counter if using ASAP. Otherwise place on shelf in cold room (4 $^o$C), make sure foil lid on tight.
#### LC prep
- Preparing M9 minimal media LCs:
	- (if not done so already) To the autoclaved flasks from the day prior, add [all amounts givem /1 L LC]:
	-
	-
