run 'pandoc labnotebook.md -o labnotebook.html' followed by 'pydifft cpb labnotebook.md' to update and view html doc as a pdf 
I don't have it set yet to auto-update the .html each time the .md file is saved, because of this you do need to rerun both command above in sequence to see any most recently made changes
	- this is slightly frustrating as you need to close and reopen the .html to do this

## July 2025

#### 7/7/2025: Coordinating coming into NU lab, emailing with Pravin and Songi, resonator design manuscript, also worked on thesis outline

#### 7/8/2025: First day on NU campus; Meeting with Pravin about PVA and AFP III project.
Meeting notes 

- PVA use as an ice recrystallization inhibitor
- Sugar cosolutes: sucrose, glucose, trehalose
	- Although weak themselves, sugars can enhance ice recrystallization inhibitors
- Goal of avoiding ice crystal conglomeration during freezing
- Formation of semi-rigid hydration layers by PVA between forming ice crystals, want to further investigate the mechanism/interaction between PVA with water that inhibits the conglomeration of larger ice crystals from forming
- Showed data supporting evidence of different thermal hysteresis between different AFP III mutants, potential (inadvertent?) structure/function effects due to cysteine mutagenesis for spin-labeling purposes
- PVA in water forms hydrogels following a freeze-thaw cycle
- 6 cycles of freeze-thaw show an independence of concentration in gel formation (?), gel porosity has dependence on concentration
- Using 17O NMR chemical shifts to detect the extent of tetrahedral “semi-rigid” hydration layer formation between PVA and forming ice crystals
- Tracking PVA mobility in solution pre- and post-freezing of PVA-H2O solutions during ice crystallization
- Imaging of ice crystal size/conglomeration using microscopy (new microscope)
	- Told about freeze-thawing cycle on a microscope slide to view ice recrystallization and its potential inhibition

#### 7/9/2025: Reading, resonator manuscript work on the side

#### 7/18/2025: Freeze-thaw test, reading/writing AFP outline, shop for new thermometer + datalogger
- probe types to get; K/J most common, K better than J most of the time, we want T type probe and meter capabilities for low temperatures
- Thermocouple graded wire is better, look into getting with new T type probe
- short meeting with Songi about AFP project, wants me to start working on manuscript ahead of time while doing background readings

#### 7/19/2025 thru 7/21/2025: Away/traveling for family event

- processing and analysis for coupled res designs (results figure for manuscript)

#### 7/28/2025: Prepare for using microscope, expression media prep, new digital meter and probes arrived
- media prep, also started media prep for M9 solutions before corrected plan through conversation with Pravin
	- have 10X M9 Salt solution available for future use
- SC: In 100 mL flask,
	- 0.5 g LB + 20 mL filtered MilliQ H2O
- LC: In 1000 mL flask,
	- 12.5 g LB + 500 mL filtered MilliQ H2O
- 10X M9 Salts: in 1 L Borosilicate buffer bottle,
	- 134.035 g Na2HPO4 (500 mM)
	- 27.218 g KH2PO4 (200 mM)
	- 5.2596 g NaCl (90 mM)
	- add stir bar PRIOR TO SALTS, cover with Al foil, add 800-900 mL filtered MilliQ H2O, heat + stir to dissolve, pH to 7.4-7.5, remove stir bar and replace into 1 L buffer bottle filling to 1000 mL
- Taking notes and watching tutorial videos for Bx53m microscope (Olympus)
- Digital meter arrived, started reading manual for use next day (not very informative)
- More focused on writing and edits to res design manuscript as VM software license issue, emailed SU ITS over weekend for assistance

#### 7/29/2025: Start AFP expression (S, Day 1), digital thermometer/datalogger
- after many failures, learned issue with autoclave had to do with following written protocol (out-of-date) and intended/outdated procedure (still not fully written out), just use 'Liquid 30' cycle, no 'Dry 30' equilvalent as far as I'm aware for this autoclave (autoclave 1 and 2 on 4th floor)
- Installed SE521 software for datalogger, TestLink app on phone for bluetooth moitoring capabilities of datalogger
- Learning how to change datalogger settings, less active monitoring to save some battery life
	- start run for comparison of 3 K type probes
- Inoculated with GB1 cell stocks from -80 freezer (wt and N8)
	- Miscommunications with Pravin (Learned on 8/15 after starting expression over):
		- GB1 AFP III wt stock (and all GB1 stocks) have Kanamycin resistance (not Ampicillin)
		- AFP III wt stock (not GB1) has Amp resistance
	- for both Amp and Kan stocks; 1 M was too concentrated for both, Amp also doesn't have great solubility in 100% ethanol
	- Instead; made both Amp and Kan stocks to 1000X concentrations ("1X" = 125 $\mu$g/mL for Amp, = 50 $\mu$g/mL for Kan) and made both in filtered MilliQ H2O
- "1000X" Amp = 625 mg Ampicillin in 5 mL filtered MilliQ H2O
- "1000X" Kan = 250 mg Kanamycin in 5 mL filtered MilliQ H2O

#### 7/30/2025: LC Day 2, res design manuscript
- Supplemental soution prep for large cultures, concerned about lack of SC growth for AFP III wt (see above for explanation)
	- 1 M MgSO4 = 0.602 g in 5 mL filtered MilliQ H2O, add 1 mL to reach 2 mM conc in LC
	- 20% glucose = 2 g in 10 mL filtered MilliQ H2O, add 8.75 mL reach 0.35% in LC
	- Also add 500 $\mu$L 1000X Kan (1X in LC) made day prior
- Inoculate LCs with 10 mL SCs, only continuing with N8C mutant because wt didn't grow. Monitor with OD measurements 1pm - 4:25 pm, 1 hr to 30 min intervals, 1 cm cuvette OD measurements throughout growth
	- OD reached 0.66
- Induce with 100 mM IPTG, make with 0.2383 g IPTG in 10 mL filtered MilliQ H2O
	- add 5 mL 100 mM IPTG to LC, final conc of 1 mM in LC solution
- Res Design: Issue with software license on VM resolved, more focused on finishing coupled parametric lorentzian figure for updating manuscript results

#### 7/31/2025: Pelleting (pause before lysis), res design manuscript, dissertation self-assessment for SU
- Samples for post-induction, monitor ODs after overnights
	- save for PAGE gel after gravity column separation during purification steps
- Pelleted in large poylpropylene bottles in large centrifuge, massing pellets, separated LC into equal masses between polypropylene bottles
- Resuspend pellets in 20 mL filtered MilliQ H2O, transferring to 50 mL conical tubes. 10 mL resuspend + 10 mL wash of reminents inside PP bottles
- Continue working on res design manuscript, updating results/figures and introduction for any still needed changes
- Continue dissertation self-assessment for SU, also need to send to JF for review/comments

## August 2025

#### 8/1/2025: Submit updated res. design manuscript to JF, work on dissertation self-assessment
- pausing purification because of lack of large filters, Pravin ordering separate filters as well as reusable one
- Finalise resonator design manuscriot to send to JF for comments/edits
- Han Lab group meeting
- Rereading old notes spurred further edits to manuscript at the end of the day

#### 8/4/2025: working on self-assessment, AFP reading  
- Going through slack and notebooks of the past year back to June 2024 to summarize work that I've done over this time period and how each thing relates towards completing my dissertation.
- Continue AFP readings, focus more on AFP type III

#### 8/5/2025: H2O Subgroup, Testing Olympus microscope
- H2O subgroup:
	- goal of trying modified splat assay at end of current expression
		- test new microscope, use a PVA solution to try to recreate existing images
		- capture pictures while thermocycling
- Setting up using new microscope, trying to connect communication between camera and temperature control system.

#### 8/6/2025: Lysis and gravity column of N8 sample, Meeting with JF around eigenmode manuscript and self-assessment
- Meeting with JF:
	- Resonator Design manuscript:
		- more citations needed; helix modes, coupling/adding transmission line (check out Eatons)
		- attempt 3D plot wrt Qs
		- PML addition serves as a bridge to adding coupling within the benefit of the eigenmode setup
	- Correlation Alignment code/manuscript:
		- rethink current PR; want to modify (already started) `rough_table_of_integrals` function to be `table_of_integrals` to then separate processing inside function to be used both for a rough or correlated alignment in processing
		- change current proc_align example script to just run this function, make more flexible and shorter, dont want any unecessary processing done inside
- Start of AFP N8C purification:
	- spin down frozen pellets
	- resuspend in lysis buffer (made with protease inhibitor tablet + 1 flake DNAse in HEPES buffer)
	- follow (Pravin's modified) protocol for lysis
		- need to use Meade lab centrifuge for separating protein into lysate supernatant
	- make imidazole wash and elution buffers in HEPES buffer
	- setup and use of gravity column for protein chromatography
- Filling in more of self-assessment
- T type probe compare with K type probe measurements @ -20 °C (bc freezer in use for other samples, issues with other -20 °C freezer)

#### 8/7/2025: A280nm measurements of fractions + PAGE gels on expression/purification progress, Plan out PVA + cosulote solutions for modified splat assay attempt
- made small commits for correlation alignment PR
- PAGE gel results matched expectations from A280nm measurements of fractions
- Looking into SE (FPLC) protocol to attempt tommorrow on combined + concentrated fractions
- self-assessment (ontinued filling in)

#### 8/8/2025: Start of SE, Prep concentration gradient solutions for modified splat assay tests wth PVA + sucrose, Group Meeting, self-assessment
- Started concentrating protein for SE, stopped because of pause for group meeting and conflict with another researcher needing concentrator
	- Shifted plan to concentrate and do SE next day
- Initial Protocol for modified splat assay:
	- Need:
		- vacuum grease
		- cover slips (x2)
		- solution of interest (1 mg/mL PVA + 0.576 M sucrose in HEPES buffer)
	- Slide prep:
		- Border slide with vacuum grease using pipette tip (look for better utensil for this)
		- Pipette on slide with vacuum grease
		- Top with 2nd cover slip to seal
	- Temperature cycle with Linkam system:
		1. Purge line with 40 °C heated N₂ before each run
			- this clears the line of any remaining H2O that may be in the system
			- done for 5 min (no time specified in supp. material)
		2. Rapid flash-freeze @ 40 °C/min to -50 °C, hold for 5 min (is this too long?)
		3. Increase to -6 °C @ 10 °C/min
		4. Hold @ -6 °C for 130 min, capture images @ 0 min + every 5 min
- Installed drivers for Lumenera Infinity camera
	- 8/19 = learned from Jim @ McCrone that we need an additional module to be able to use this camera with the Link software
- worked more on self-assessment goals and outlook

#### 8/9/2025: Prepare protein and start SE (FPLC)
- Concentrate protein at 10 min intervals, 4500 rcf @ 4 °C
- pipette to mix after each cycle, visually checking volume
- goal of reaching a volume of ~ 4 mL for 5 mL sample loop
- also made another 1 L of HEPES buffer for use with FPL
- Finished initial draft of self-assessment and sent to JF 

#### 8/11/2025: FPL results, Modified splat assay
- took A280 measurements of all 70 fractions from FPL
	- protein not observed in any fractions UV failed during run (or may have not been working before)
	- Still not certain where protein went, may have passed to waste container, checking tubing connections protein passing directly to the waste doesn't seem to be the case
	- want to try a run of different proteins in mixture to use for calibration (known proteins like lysozyme, human insulin recombinant enzyme, BSA (or analogous equivalent), fetuin?)
- Reading microscope and camera manuals
- Using made PVA stocks to try modified splat assay again, error for 'stage temperature sensor' happened. Tried to resolve but couldn't following instructions with error + online

#### 8/12/2025: Contact McCrone rep for microscope and Linkam system, H2O subgroup, start new expression
- H2O subgroup meeting:
	- Need to contact Olympus and BioRad reps about current issues/repairs
	- Keep on readings about AFP, start to outline AFP paper, especially focus on plan for ODNP and related experiments
	- Showed freezer info with K type vs T type probe comparisons, SH wants me to "hack" freezer to stay in a more consistent feedback loop closer to a more consistent -6 $^\circ$C measurement, involves breaking open freezer circuitry to modify freezer's thermostat
	- SH agreed with trying a mixture of protein standards through the FPL for checking issue of what might not be working
	- Start new expression, make sure to also do wt (not just N8C mutant)
- Contacted Jim (James J.) Bristol, jbristol@mccrone.com, who is tech and sales rep from McCrone for the Olympus microscope, Linkam temperature stage and Infinity 8 camera, contacted regarding error message from 8/11
- start SCs for wt and N8C, still didn't know about difference between regular wt and GB1 wt wrt Amp vs Kan resistance so wt SC didn't grow O/N again
- Cleaned FPLC with manual run, 700 mL wash using 30 % ethanol solution

#### 8/13/2025: LC of AFP expr (N8C mutant), repeat SC for wt correctly, self-assessment edits, RCR training
- inoculate and monitor LC for N8C mutant (11 am - 3 pm, 1hr to 30 min monitoring intervals)
- made plan with Pravin for what to do for FPLC run with protein standards, not doing today as Will needs for MagLOV
- again saw wt SC not grow, talking with Pravin, learned of different wt stocks (regular AFP III wt and GB1 tagged AFP III wt)
	-all GB1 tagged protein for AFP have Kan resistance, the "normal" AFP III wt is encoded with an Amp resistance tag to its plasmid instead
- JF sent edits for self-assessment, started working on these to send back 8/14 AM (self-assessment due EOD 8/15) 
- started working on RCR trainings through out day

#### 8/14/2025: self-assessment edits, LC monitoring for wt, Induced monitoring + Pelleting + Lysis for N8C
- sent back modified self-assessment to JF, some back-forth during the day making small changes
- solution prep and enrichment of LC LB media, also taking and ODing 'day after' induction samples of N8C for PAGE (100 $\mu$L samples)
- inoculated and monitored wt LC (10 am - 1:30 pm)
- Induced wt LC @ 6:45 pm, taking 100 $\mu$L sample for PAGE
- Pelleted N8C induced LC after monitoring, started Lysis using Lysis buffer noted on 8/6
	- sonicated 
	- Lysis pelleted after (Meade group centrifuge, high speed rotor)
	- Ni-NTA column using imidazole solutions, elution into 20 ~1 mL fractions 
- RCR trainings while monitoring LC

#### 8/15/2025: Submitted self-assessment, Induced monitoring + pelleting + lysis for wt, gel of N8C fracs, GM (KT and SM defense practices)
- A$_280$ nm measurements of N8C fractions, had to redo later because of nanodrop miscalibration
- took 14 hr and 16 hr induced LC samples for wt
- Pelleted wt in 2 separate container (large PP bottles), acquired pellet masses of 1.64 g and 2.34 g
- Lysis for N8C, this went into GM time but finished before end of GM
	- Had to do lysis before 5 PM as I needed to use the Meade group centrifuge and want to make sure to have it available for the final steps of lysis (pelleting remaining dead cell parts and recovering protein in lysate supernatant)
- GM: both KT and SM have slides on ODNP, tried to help explain and offered advice for presenting smoothly ("time-dependent measure that relies on molecular motion")
- reran A$_280$ nm measurements of N8C, prepped samples to run gel on all fractions + induced LC + Lysate supernatant + gravity column wash samples
	- this amounts to needing to run 3 gels in total
- Started gels at 7 pm, gels do not run at even rates in chamber, much better rates for 2 gels in direct contact with power supply through gel chamber terminals instead of the lids extenders
	- gel power supply also kept forcing run with constant amperage instead of constant voltage, not sure why or if this is due to running with > 2 gels and using the circuit extenders as a part of the chambers lid
- gravity column of wt:
	- used new beads, saving used N8C combined in 50 mL falcon tube in fridge with other used beads from last expression
	- 2 equilibrations, not sure why as I believe I only did 1 equilibration the last expression. Looking at notes I don't see what I did that was different and all volumes I used (particularly the Lysis buffer volume as this is what determines the lysate supernatant volume after pelleting was the same. Ask PT if we concentrate the Lysate supernatant before running the gravity column for next time.
		-saved equilibration flow-throughs in separate falcon tube than wash buffer flow-throughs to see difference in gels
	- eluted into 20 fractions
- RCR trainings at EOD while running gels and gravity column

#### 8/16/2025: Talked with PT about PVA project, gels for wt fractions, RCR trainings
- A$_280$ nm measurements of wt fractions, prepped frac samples for gel
- needed to make more 1X MES SDS PAGE buffer solution (made 1 L from 20X stock)
- after getting gel started; took images of N8C gels from day prior
* saw similar issues to day prior with gels taking long time to run, constant amp vs constant voltage, differences in gel run times relative to distance from gel chamber terminals
- ordered more PAGE gel ladder
- RCR trainings still... (15 modules in total and each take 1-2 hours)
- purchased flashdrive on way home

#### 8/17/2025: Came in for short time (~1 hr) to image wt gels and consolidate all gels into single container in fridge
- saved all gels I have ran to new flashdrive

#### 8/18/2025: Plan for FPLC test, microscope for modified splat assay, meeting with JF about res design manuscript
- shopping for/ planning for freezer, looking up what to do to manually modifiy in meantime
- tried modified splat assay again, couldn't get temperature stage to work (still having issue with misconnection)
	- broke lid glass at EOD when doing later tries to try to focus at 40X magnification, VERY BAD
- annotated 6 gels from weekend
- prepped for subgroup meeting on 8/19 (ended up doing SM practice instead)
- I went with PT to Meade group to ask about potentially using their FPLC, they have multi wavelength detector but no sample collector for fractions
- Almost finished all RCR trainings

#### 8/19/2025: Digital lab notebook, finished RCR trainings, SM defense practice, KT defense, SU form
- filling in digital lab notebook, made a new repo to type out in markdown and share with PT
- finished last 1.5 modules of RCR trainings, email with completetion certificate
- tried modifying freezer manually, made slightly worse and reverted
	- ordered external thermostat to use instead as well as propylene glycol as liquid solution to also use for temperature calibration with both probes

#### 8/20/2025: Shopping for Bio Rad FPLC LED UV lamp and glass window replacement for Linkam stage, CT defense, Digital lab notebook, Res design manuscript edits
- Tried Linkam support system to request replacement window piece for stage

- researching + shopping for in-line/flow UV detectors that could substitute current NGC UV module in FPLC system 
- edits to resonator design manuscript
	- quarter wavestop and relation to iris screw in waveguide behaving similar, periodicity of spikes in coupling with iris screw follow 1/2 $\lambda_{guide}$ length in height of waveguide away from the coupling hole
	- Reading about ENDOR and ENDOR resonators, especially those with helix/solenoid probes
- Updating digital lab notebook, was super backlogged
- Emails with Jim at McCrone very helpful, should be nothing wrong with Linkam stage but waiting for 2nd feedback from Linakm and he says not to worroy too much about getting glass replced, still need to get quote for glass though (`jbristol@mccrone.com`)

#### 8/22/2025: Test new thermostat, shopping for flow/in-line UV detectors, digital lab notebook, resonator design manuscript
- set up new thermostat in PM, ran O/N with datalogger to test for improved temperature cycling while still trying to stay within the freezer's compressor limits, set at -6 $^\circ$C with 0.3 $^\circ$C High and Low differentials. Freezer set to -10 $^\circ$C
- reading about AFP in hydrogel studies, including one with rheology
- further updating lab notebook
