## July 2025

#### 7/7/2025: Coordinating coming into NU lab, emailing with Pravin and Songi, resonator design manuscript, also worked on thesis outline

#### 7/8/2025: First day on NU campus; Meeting with Pravin about PVA and AFP III project.
Meeting notes 

- PVA use as an ice recrystallization inhibitor
- Sugar cosolutes: sucrose, glucose, trehalose
	- Although weak themselves, sugars can enhance ice recrystallization inhibitors
- Goal of avoiding ice crystal conglomeration during freezing
- Formation of semi-rigid hydration layers by PVA between forming ice crystals, want to further investigate the mechanism/interaction between PVA with water that inhibits the conglomeration of larger ice crystals from forming
- Showed data supporting evidence of different thermal hysteresis between different AFP III mutants, potential (inadvertent?) structure/function effects due to cysteine mutagenesis for spin-labeling purposes
- PVA in water forms hydrogels following a freeze-thaw cycle
- 6 cycles of freeze-thaw show an independence of concentration in gel formation (?), gel porosity has dependence on concentration
- Using 17O NMR chemical shifts to detect the extent of tetrahedral “semi-rigid” hydration layer formation between PVA and forming ice crystals
- Tracking PVA mobility in solution pre- and post-freezing of PVA-H2O solutions during ice crystallization
- Imaging of ice crystal size/conglomeration using microscopy (new microscope)
	- Told about freeze-thawing cycle on a microscope slide to view ice recrystallization and its potential inhibition

#### 7/9/2025: Reading, resonator manuscript work on the side
-	talked more with Pravin about AFPs and project, sent folder of AFP references to start reviewing.
-	Background research on AFP types, particularly type III, and their functions in living organisms.

#### 7/10/2025 and 7/11/2025: Reading for AFP, data analysis and writing for resonator design manuscript
-	mode matching for resonator design project, work towards mapping modes figures, writing some results
-	reskimmed Meth in Enzo Han/Franck chapter, have more questions about molecular and spin diffusion
-	reading Gharib/Kosar review on AFPs

#### 7/13/2025: More reading of Gharib/Kosar

#### 7/14/2025: Starting paperwork with Alexis for hiring
- meeting with Songi and Pravin; need to look into Maria's and Candice's work on AFP and hydration dynamics studies
- learn more about FTS system both for NMR/ESR/ODNP and for using and calibrating light microscope

#### 7/15/2025: H2O subgroup meeting, plan with freezer, AFP reading and plan for paper
- test new freezer, working on freezer calibration
- Aim of AFP paper (ODNP portion) -  map hydration dynamics around ice binding and non-ice binding regions, investigate the mechanism for changes to TH and IRI of mutants due to single site cysteine mutations 
- prep for sucrose in HEPES control test with new freezer
logging freezer activities,

#### 7/16/2025: Monitor freezer, Calibrate thermometer and probes
- make HEPES buffer and sucrose solution for looking to generate ice slurry in freezer
- reading about AFPs, reviews and Joon-Hwa Lee group NMR studies
- also started calibration of THE-343 digital thermometer, determined > 1 C offset in determined temperature while calibrating in ice bath
- made 10 mL 18% sucrose in HEPES buffer solution to use for coming days/weeks

#### 7/17/2025: Paperwork, reading, freezer/thermometer testing, resonator manuscript
- emails regarding I9, do part 1 but needed to find SS card
- Reading AFP lit
- monitoring freezer still, probe not very good
- comparison of map of uncoupled modes over varying pitch and map of coupled modes over varying pitch
- monitoring THE343 thermometer, cross-referencing with Hg thermometer, taking readings every 1-2 hrs

#### 7/18/2025: Freeze-thaw test, reading/writing AFP outline, shop for new thermometer + datalogger
- probe types to get; K/J most common, K better than J most of the time, we want T type probe and meter capabilities for low temperatures
- Thermocouple graded wire is better, look into getting with new T type probe
- short meeting with Songi about AFP project, wants me to start working on manuscript ahead of time while doing background readings

#### 7/19/2025 thru 7/21/2025: Away/traveling for family event 

#### 7/22/2025: freezer, reading, resonator design manuscript
- Need to attend H2O subgroup meetings on Tuesdays, 11 am (missed)
- Still seeing large variations in measured temps between probe vs thermometer and intended freezer setting
- Monitoring 2 thermometers, visual inspection of 10 mL sucrose in HEPES solution as it thaws/refreezes

#### 7/23/2025: Freeze-thaw test in capillary, AFP Reading, resonator design manuscript figures
- semi-regular logging of freezer temperatures for determining freezer range of temperature oscillation
- Performed flash-freeze with freeze-thaw cycle of sucrose solution (no PVA) in an ESR capillary with Pravin
	- Observed ice "needle" formation and recrystallization, alos able to see ice-water equilibrium at the start of ice nucleation

#### 7/24/2025: freeze monitoring, AFP reading, res design data processing
- Looking into Demuller freezer manual, want to modfiy temperature freezer cycles to be closer to -6C for longer and/or stray less further away from target.
- Reading about AFP III subtypes, quaternary-amino-ethyl types 1 (typically TH active) and 2 and sulfopropyl (each more typically TH inactive)

#### 7/25/2025: Listening/watching in on microscope training, AFP reading, res design
- microscope arrived; listening in during training
- preparing to start on AFP expression next Monday, reading protocols and coming up with questions
- processing and analysis for coupled res designs (results figure for manuscript)

#### 7/28/2025: Prepare for using microscope, expression media prep, new digital meter and probes arrived
- media prep, also started media prep for M9 solutions before corrected plan through conversation with Pravin
	- have 10X M9 Salt solution available for future use
- Taking notes and watching tutorial videos for Bx53m microscope
- Digital meter arrived, started reading manual for use next day (not very informative)
- More focused on writing and edits to res design manuscript as VM software license issue, emailed SU ITS over weekend for assistance

#### 7/29/2025: Start AFP expression (SC, Day 1), digital thermometer/datalogger
- after many failures, learned issue with autoclave had to do with following written protocol (out-of-date) and intended/outdated procedure (still not fully written out), just use 'Liquid 30' cycle, no 'Dry 30' equilvalent as far as I'm aware for this autoclave (autoclave 1 and 2 on 4th floor)
- Installed SE521 software for datalogger, TestLink app on phone for bluetooth moitoring capabilities of datalogger
- Learning how to change datalogger settings, less active monitoring to save some battery life
	- start run for comparison of 3 K type probes
- Inoculated with GB1 cell stocks from -80 freezer (wt and N8C)
	- Miscommunications with Pravin (Learned on 8/15 after starting expression over):
		- GB1 AFP III wt stock (and all GB1 stocks) have Kanamycin resistance (not Ampicillin)
		- AFP III wt stock (not GB1) has Amp resistance
	- for both Amp and Kan stocks; 1 M was too concentrated for both, Amp also doesn't have great solubility in 100% ethanol
	- Instead; made both Amp and Kan stocks to 1000X concentrations ("1X" = 125 $\mu$g/mL for Amp, = 50 $\mu$g/mL for Kan) an dmade both in filtered MilliQ H2O

#### 7/30/2025: LC Day 2, res design manuscript
- Supplemental soution prep for large cultures, concerned about lack of SC growth for AFP III wt (see above for explanation)
- Inoculate LCs with 10 mL SCs, only continuing with N8C mutant because wt didn't grow. Monitor with OD measurements 1pm - 4:25 pm, 1 hr to 30 min intervals, 1 cm cuvette OD measurements throughout growth
- Res Design: Issue with software license on VM resolved, more focused on finishing coupled parametric lorentzian figure for updating manuscript results

#### 7/31/2025: Pelleting (pause before lysis), res design manuscript, dissertation self-assessment for SU
- Samples for post-induction, monitor ODs after overnights
	- save for PAGE gel after gravity column separation during purification steps
- Pelleted in large poylpropylene bottles in large centrifuge, massing pellets, separated LC into equal masses between polypropylene bottles
- Resuspend pellets in 20 mL filtered MilliQ H2O, transferring to 50 mL conical tubes. 10 mL resuspend + 10 mL wash of reminents inside PP bottles
- Continue working on res design manuscript, updating results/figures and introduction for any still needed changes
- Continue dissertation self-assessment for SU, also need to send to JF for review/comments

## August 2025

#### 8/1/2025: Submit updated res. design manuscript to JF, work on dissertation self-assessment
- pausing purification because of lack of large filters, Pravin ordering separate filters as well as reusable one
- Finalise resonator design manuscriot to send to JF for comments/edits
- Han Lab group meeting
- Rereading old notes spurred further edits to manuscript at the end of the day

#### 8/4/2025: working on self-assessment, AFP reading,  
- Going through slack and notebooks of the past year back to June 2024 to summarize work that I've done over this time period and how each thing relates towards completing my dissertation.
