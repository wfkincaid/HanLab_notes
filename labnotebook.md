## July 2025

#### 7/7/2025: Coordinating coming into NU lab, emailing with Pravin and Songi, resonator design manuscript, also worked on thesis outline

#### 7/8/2025: First day on NU campus; Meeting with Pravin about PVA and AFP III project.
Meeting notes 

- PVA use as an ice recrystallization inhibitor
- Sugar cosolutes: sucrose, glucose, trehalose
	- Although weak themselves, sugars can enhance ice recrystallization inhibitors
- Goal of avoiding ice crystal conglomeration during freezing
- Formation of semi-rigid hydration layers by PVA between forming ice crystals, want to further investigate the mechanism/interaction between PVA with water that inhibits the conglomeration of larger ice crystals from forming
- Showed data supporting evidence of different thermal hysteresis between different AFP III mutants, potential (inadvertent?) structure/function effects due to cysteine mutagenesis for spin-labeling purposes
- PVA in water forms hydrogels following a freeze-thaw cycle
- 6 cycles of freeze-thaw show an independence of concentration in gel formation (?), gel porosity has dependence on concentration
- Using 17O NMR chemical shifts to detect the extent of tetrahedral “semi-rigid” hydration layer formation between PVA and forming ice crystals
- Tracking PVA mobility in solution pre- and post-freezing of PVA-H2O solutions during ice crystallization
- Imaging of ice crystal size/conglomeration using microscopy (new microscope)
	- Told about freeze-thawing cycle on a microscope slide to view ice recrystallization and its potential inhibition

#### 7/9/2025: Reading, resonator manuscript work on the side
-	talked more with Pravin about AFPs and project, sent folder of AFP references to start reviewing.
-	Background research on AFP types, particularly type III, and their functions in living organisms.

#### 7/10/2025 and 7/11/2025: Reading for AFP, data analysis and writing for resonator design manuscript

#### 7/13/2025: More reading of Gharib/Kosar

#### 7/14/2025: Starting paperwork with Alexis for hiring
- meeting with Songi and Pravin; need to look into Maria's and andice's work on AFP and hydration dynamics studies
- learn more about FTS system both for NMR/ESR/ODNP and for using and calibrating light microscope

#### 7/15/2025: H2O subgroup meeting, plan with freezer, AFP reading and plan for paper
- test new freezer, working on freezer calibration
- Aim of AFP paper (ODNP portion) 
	- map hydration dynamics around ice binding and non-ice binding regions, investigate the mechanism for changes to TH and IRI of mutants due to single site cysteine mutations 
- prep for sucrose in HEPES control test with new freezer logging freezer activities

#### 7/16/2025: Monitor freezer, Calibrate thermometer and probes
- make HEPES buffer and sucrose solution for looking to generate ice slurry in freezer
- reading about AFPs, reviews and Joon-Hwa Lee group NMR studies
- also started calibration of THE-343 digital thermometer, determined > 1 °C offset in determined temperature while calibrating in ice bath
- made 10 mL 18% sucrose in HEPES buffer solution to use for coming days/weeks

#### 7/17/2025: Paperwork, reading, freezer/thermometer testing, resonator manuscript
- emails regarding I9, do part 1 but needed to find SS card
- Reading AFP lit
- monitoring freezer still, probe not very good
- comparison of map of uncoupled modes over varying pitch and map of coupled modes over varying pitch
- monitoring THE343 thermometer, cross-referencing with Hg thermometer, taking readings every 1-2 hrs

#### 7/18/2025: Freeze-thaw test, reading/writing AFP outline, shop for new thermometer + datalogger
- probe types to get; K/J most common, K better than J most of the time, we want T type probe and meter capabilities for low temperatures
- Thermocouple graded wire is better, look into getting with new T type probe
- short meeting with Songi about AFP project, wants me to start working on manuscript ahead of time while doing background readings

#### 7/19/2025 thru 7/21/2025: Away/traveling for family event 

#### 7/22/2025: freezer, reading, resonator design manuscript
- Need to attend H2O subgroup meetings on Tuesdays, 11 am (missed)
- Still seeing large variations in measured temps between probe vs thermometer and intended freezer setting
- Monitoring 2 thermometers, visual inspection of 10 mL sucrose in HEPES solution as it thaws/refreezes

#### 7/23/2025: Freeze-thaw test in capillary, AFP Reading, resonator design manuscript figures
- semi-regular logging of freezer temperatures for determining freezer range of temperature oscillation
- Performed flash-freeze with freeze-thaw cycle of sucrose solution (no PVA) in an ESR capillary with Pravin
	- Observed ice "needle" formation and recrystallization, alos able to see ice-water equilibrium at the start of ice nucleation

#### 7/24/2025: freeze monitoring, AFP reading, res design data processing
- Looking into Demuller freezer manual, want to modfiy temperature freezer cycles to be closer to -6 °C for longer and/or stray less further away from target.
- Reading about AFP III subtypes, quaternary-amino-ethyl types 1 (typically TH active) and 2 and sulfopropyl (each more typically TH inactive)

#### 7/25/2025: Listening/watching in on microscope training, AFP reading, res design
- microscope arrived; listening in during training
- preparing to start on AFP expression next Monday, reading protocols and coming up with questions
- processing and analysis for coupled res designs (results figure for manuscript)

#### 7/28/2025: Prepare for using microscope, expression media prep, new digital meter and probes arrived
- media prep, also started media prep for M9 solutions before corrected plan through conversation with Pravin
	- have 10X M9 Salt solution available for future use
- SC: In 100 mL flask,
	- 0.5 g LB + 20 mL filtered MilliQ H2O
- LC: In 1000 mL flask,
	- 12.5 g LB + 500 mL filtered MilliQ H2O
- 10X M9 Salts: in 1 L Borosilicate buffer bottle,
	- 134.035 g Na2HPO4 (500 mM)
	- 27.218 g KH2PO4 (200 mM)
	- 5.2596 g NaCl (90 mM)
	- add stir bar PRIOR TO SALTS, cover with Al foil, add 800-900 mL filtered MilliQ H2O, heat + stir to dissolve, pH to 7.4-7.5, remove stir bar and replace into 1 L buffer bottle filling to 1000 mL
- Taking notes and watching tutorial videos for Bx53m microscope (Olympus)
- Digital meter arrived, started reading manual for use next day (not very informative)
- More focused on writing and edits to res design manuscript as VM software license issue, emailed SU ITS over weekend for assistance

#### 7/29/2025: Start AFP expression (S, Day 1), digital thermometer/datalogger
- after many failures, learned issue with autoclave had to do with following written protocol (out-of-date) and intended/outdated procedure (still not fully written out), just use 'Liquid 30' cycle, no 'Dry 30' equilvalent as far as I'm aware for this autoclave (autoclave 1 and 2 on 4th floor)
- Installed SE521 software for datalogger, TestLink app on phone for bluetooth moitoring capabilities of datalogger
- Learning how to change datalogger settings, less active monitoring to save some battery life
	- start run for comparison of 3 K type probes
- Inoculated with GB1 cell stocks from -80 freezer (wt and N8)
	- Miscommunications with Pravin (Learned on 8/15 after starting expression over):
		- GB1 AFP III wt stock (and all GB1 stocks) have Kanamycin resistance (not Ampicillin)
		- AFP III wt stock (not GB1) has Amp resistance
	- for both Amp and Kan stocks; 1 M was too concentrated for both, Amp also doesn't have great solubility in 100% ethanol
	- Instead; made both Amp and Kan stocks to 1000X concentrations ("1X" = 125 $\mu$g/mL for Amp, = 50 $\mu$g/mL for Kan) and made both in filtered MilliQ H2O
- "1000X" Amp = 625 mg Ampicillin in 5 mL filtered MilliQ H2O
- "1000X" Kan = 250 mg Kanamycin in 5 mL filtered MilliQ H2O

#### 7/30/2025: LC Day 2, res design manuscript
- Supplemental soution prep for large cultures, concerned about lack of SC growth for AFP III wt (see above for explanation)
	- 1 M MgSO4 = 0.602 g in 5 mL filtered MilliQ H2O, add 1 mL to reach 2 mM conc in LC
	- 20% glucose = 2 g in 10 mL filtered MilliQ H2O, add 8.75 mL reach 0.35% in LC
	- Also add 500 $\mu$L 1000X Kan (1X in LC) made day prior
- Inoculate LCs with 10 mL SCs, only continuing with N8C mutant because wt didn't grow. Monitor with OD measurements 1pm - 4:25 pm, 1 hr to 30 min intervals, 1 cm cuvette OD measurements throughout growth
	- OD reached 0.66
- Induce with 100 mM IPTG, make with 0.2383 g IPTG in 10 mL filtered MilliQ H2O
	- add 5 mL 100 mM IPTG to LC, final conc of 1 mM in LC solution
- Res Design: Issue with software license on VM resolved, more focused on finishing coupled parametric lorentzian figure for updating manuscript results

#### 7/31/2025: Pelleting (pause before lysis), res design manuscript, dissertation self-assessment for SU
- Samples for post-induction, monitor ODs after overnights
	- save for PAGE gel after gravity column separation during purification steps
- Pelleted in large poylpropylene bottles in large centrifuge, massing pellets, separated LC into equal masses between polypropylene bottles
- Resuspend pellets in 20 mL filtered MilliQ H2O, transferring to 50 mL conical tubes. 10 mL resuspend + 10 mL wash of reminents inside PP bottles
- Continue working on res design manuscript, updating results/figures and introduction for any still needed changes
- Continue dissertation self-assessment for SU, also need to send to JF for review/comments

## August 2025

#### 8/1/2025: Submit updated res. design manuscript to JF, work on dissertation self-assessment
- pausing purification because of lack of large filters, Pravin ordering separate filters as well as reusable one
- Finalise resonator design manuscriot to send to JF for comments/edits
- Han Lab group meeting
- Rereading old notes spurred further edits to manuscript at the end of the day

#### 8/4/2025: working on self-assessment, AFP reading  
- Going through slack and notebooks of the past year back to June 2024 to summarize work that I've done over this time period and how each thing relates towards completing my dissertation.
- Continue AFP readings, focus more on AFP type III

#### 8/5/2025: H2O Subgroup, Testing Olympus microscope
- H2O subgroup:
	- goal of trying modified splat assay at end of current expression
		- test new microscope, use a PVA solution to try to recreate existing images
		- capture pictures while thermocycling
- Setting up using new microscope, trying to connect communication between camera and temperature control system.

#### 8/6/2025: Lysis and gravity column of N8 sample, Meeting with JF around eigenmode manuscript and self-assessment
- Meeting with JF:
	- Resonator Design manuscript:
		- more citations needed; helix modes, coupling/adding transmission line (check out Eatons)
		- attempt 3D plot wrt Qs
		- PML addition serves as a bridge to adding coupling within the benefit of the eigenmode setup
	- Correlation Alignment code/manuscript:
		- rethink current PR; want to modify (already started) `rough_table_of_integrals` function to be `table_of_integrals` to then separate processing inside function to be used both for a rough or correlated alignment in processing
		- change current proc_align example script to just run this function, make more flexible and shorter, dont want any unecessary processing done inside
- Start of AFP N8C purification:
	- spin down frozen pellets
	- resuspend in lysis buffer (made with protease inhibitor tablet + 1 flake DNAse in HEPES buffer)
	- follow (Pravin's modified) protocol for lysis
		- need to use Meade lab centrifuge for separating protein into lysate supernatant
	- make imidazole wash and elution buffers in HEPES buffer
	- setup and use of gravity column for protein chromatography
- Filling in more of self-assessment
- T type probe compare with K type probe measurements @ -20 °C (bc freezer in use for other samples, issues with other -20 °C freezer)

#### 8/7/2025: A280nm measurements of fractions + PAGE gels on expression/purification progress, Plan out PVA + cosulote solutions for modified splat assay attempt
- made small commits for correlation alignment PR
- PAGE gel results matched expectations from A280nm measurements of fractions
- Looking into SE (FPLC) protocol to attempt tommorrow on combined + concentrated fractions
- self-assessment (ontinued filling in)

#### 8/8/2025: Start of SE, Prep concentration gradient solutions for modified splat assay tests wth PVA + sucrose, Group Meeting, self-assessment
- Started concentrating protein for SE, stopped because of pause for group meeting and conflict with another researcher needing concentrator
	- Shifted plan to concentrate and do SE next day
- Initial Protocol for modified splat assay:
	- Need:
		- vacuum grease
		- cover slips (x2)
		- solution of interest (1 mg/mL PVA + 0.576 M sucrose in HEPES buffer)
	- Slide prep:
		- Border slide with vacuum grease using pipette tip (look for better utensil for this)
		- Pipette on slide with vacuum grease
		- Top with 2nd cover slip to seal
	- Temperature cycle with Linkam system:
		1. Purge line with 40 °C heated N₂ before each run
			- this clears the line of any remaining H2O that may be in the system
			- done for 5 min (no time specified in supp. material)
		2. Rapid flash-freeze @ 40 °C/min to -50 °C, hold for 5 min (is this too long?)
		3. Increase to -6 °C @ 10 °C/min
		4. Hold @ -6 °C for 130 min, capture images @ 0 min + every 5 min
- Installed drivers for Lumenera Infinity camera
	- 8/19 = learned from Jim @ McCrone that we need an additional module to be able to use this camera with the Link software
- worked more on self-assessment goals and outlook

#### 8/9/2025: Prepare protein and start SE (FPLC)
- Concentrate protein at 10 min intervals, 4500 rcf @ 4 °C
- pipette to mix after each cycle, visually checking volume
- goal of reaching a volume of ~ 4 mL for 5 mL sample loop
- also made another 1 L of HEPES buffer for use with FPL
- Finished initial draft of self-assessment and sent to JF 

#### 8/11/2025: FPL results, Modified splat assay
- took A280 measurements of all 70 fractions from FPL
	- protein not observed in any fractions UV failed during run (or may have not been working before)
	- Still not certain where protein went, may have passed to waste container, checking tubing connections protein passing directly to the waste doesn't seem to be the case
	- want to try a run of different proteins in mixture to use for calibration (known proteins like lysozyme, human insulin recombinant enzyme, BSA (or analogous equivalent), fetuin?)
- Reading microscope and camera manuals
- Using made PVA stocks to try modified splat assay again, error for 'stage temperature sensor' happened. Tried to resolve but couldn't following instructions with error + online

#### 8/12/2025: Contact McCrone rep for microscope and Linkam system, H2O subgroup, start new expression
- H2O subgroup meeting:
	- Need to contact Olympus and BioRad reps about current issues/repairs
	- Keep on readings about AFP, start to outline AFP paper, especially focus on plan for ODNP and related experiments
	- Showed freezer info with K type vs T type probe comparisons, SH wants me to "hack" freezer to stay in a more consistent feedback loop closer to a more consistent -6 °C measurement, involves breaking open freezer circuitry to modify freezer's thermostat
	- SH agreed with trying a mixture of protein standards through the FPL for checking issue of what might not be working
	- Start new expression, make sure to also do wt (not just N8C mutant)
- Contacted Jim (James J.) Bristol, jbristol@mccrone.com, who is tech and sales rep from McCrone for the Olympus microscope, Linkam temperature stage and Infinity 8 camera, contacted regarding error message from 8/11
- start SCs for wt and N8C, still didn't know about difference between regular wt and GB1 wt wrt Amp vs Kan resistance so wt SC didn't grow O/N again
- Cleaned FPLC with manual run, 700 mL wash using 30 % ethanol solution

#### 8/13/2025: LC of AFP expr (N8C mutant), repeat SC for wt correctly, self-assessment edits
- inoculate and monitor LC for N8C mutant (11 am - 3 pm, 1hr to 30 min monitoring intervals)
- made plan with Pravin for what to do for FPLC run with protein standards, not doing today as Will needs for MagLOV
- again saw wt SC not grow, talking with Pravin, learned of different wt stocks (regular AFP III wt and GB1 tagged AFP III wt)
	-all GB1 tagged protein for AFP have Kan resistance, the "normal" AFP III wt is encoded with an Amp resistance tag to its plasmid instead
- JF sent edits for self-assessment, started working on these to send back 8/14 AM (self-assessment due EOD 8/15) 

#### 8/14/2025: self-assessment edits, LC monitoring for wt, Induced monitoring + Pelleting + Lysis for N8C
- sent back modified self-assessment to JF, some back-forth during the day making small changes
- solution prep and enrichment of LC LB media, also taking and ODing 'day after' induction samples of N8C for PAGE (100 $\mu$L samples)
- inoculated and monitored wt LC (10 am - 1:30 pm)
- Induced wt LC @ 6:45 pm, taking 100 $\mu$L sample for PAGE
- Pelleted N8C induced LC after monitoring, started Lysis using Lysis buffer noted on 8/6
	- sonicated 
	- Lysis pelleted after (Meade group centrifuge, high speed rotor)
	- Ni-NTA column using imidazole solutions, elution into 20 ~1 mL fractions
