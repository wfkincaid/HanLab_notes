## July 2025

#### 7/7/2025: Coordinating coming into NU lab, emailing with Pravin and Songi, resonator design manuscript, also worked on thesis outline

#### 7/8/2025: First day on NU campus; Meeting with Pravin about PVA and AFP III project.
Meeting notes 

-	PVA use as an ice recrystallization inhibitor
-	Sugar cosolutes: sucrose, glucose, trehalose
o	Although weak themselves, sugars can enhance ice recrystallization inhibitors
-	Goal of avoiding ice crystal conglomeration during freezing
-	Formation of semi-rigid hydration layers by PVA between forming ice crystals, want to further investigate the mechanism/interaction between PVA with water that inhibits the conglomeration of larger ice crystals from forming
-	Showed data supporting evidence of different thermal hysteresis between different AFP III mutants, potential (inadvertent?) structure/function effects due to cysteine mutagenesis for spin-labeling purposes
-	 PVA in water forms hydrogels following a freeze-thaw cycle
-	6 cycles of freeze-thaw show an independence of concentration in gel formation (?), gel porosity has dependence on concentration
-	Using 17O NMR chemical shifts to detect the extent of tetrahedral “semi-rigid” hydration layer formation between PVA and forming ice crystals
-	Tracking PVA mobility in solution pre- and post-freezing of PVA-H2O solutions during ice crystallization
-	 Imaging of ice crystal size/conglomeration using microscopy (new microscope)
o	Told about freeze-thawing cycle on a microscope slide to view ice recrystallization and its potential inhibition

#### 7/9/2025:
-	talked more with Pravin about AFPs and project, sent folder of AFP references to start reviewing.
-	Background research on AFP types, particularly type III, and their functions in living organisms.

#### 7/10/2025 and 7/11/2025: Reading for AFP, data analysis and writing for resonator design manuscript
-	mode matching for resonator design project, work towards mapping modes figures, writing some results
-	reskimmed Meth in Enzo Han/Franck chapter, have more questions about molecular and spin diffusion
-	reading Gharib/Kosar review on AFPs

#### 7/13/2025: More reading of Gharib/Kosar

#### 7/14/2025: Starting paperwork with Alexis for hiring
- meeting with Songi and Pravin; need to look into Maria's and Candice's work on AFP and hydration dynamics studies
- learn more about FTS system both for NMR/ESR/ODNP and for using and calibrating light microscope

#### 7/15/2025: H2O subgroup meeting, plan with freezer, AFP reading and plan for paper
- test new freezer, working on freezer calibration
- Aim of AFP paper (ODNP portion) -  map hydration dynamics around ice binding and non-ice binding regions, investigate the mechanism for changes to TH and IRI of mutants due to single site cysteine mutations 
- prep for sucrose in HEPES control test with new freezer
logging freezer activities,

#### 7/16/2025: Monitor freezer, Calibrate thermometer and probes
- make HEPES buffer and sucrose solution for looking to generate ice slurry in freezer
- reading about AFPs, reviews and Joon-Hwa Lee group NMR studies
- also started calibration of THE-343 digital thermometer, determined > 1 C offset in determined temperature while calibrating in ice bath
- made 10 mL 18% sucrose in HEPES buffer solution to use for coming days/weeks

#### 7/17/2025: Paperwork, reading, freezer/thermometer testing, resonator manuscript
- emails regarding I9, do part 1 but needed to find SS card
- Reading AFP lit
- monitoring freezer still, probe not very good
- comparison of map of uncoupled modes over varying pitch and map of coupled modes over varying pitch
- monitoring THE343 thermometer, cross-referencing with Hg thermometer, taking readings every 1-2 hrs

#### 7/18/2025: Freeze-thaw test, reading/writing AFP outline, shop for new thermometer + datalogger
- probe types to get; K/J most common, K better than J most of the time, we want T type probe and meter capabilities for low temperatures
- Thermocouple graded wire is better, look into getting with new T type probe
- short meeting with Songi about AFP project, wants me to start working on manuscript ahead of time while doing background readings

#### 7/19/2025 thru 7/21/2025: Away/traveling for family event 

#### 7/22/2025: freezer, reading, resonator design manuscript
- Need to attend H2O subgroup meetings on Tuesdays, 11 am (missed)
- Still seeing large variations in measured temps between probe vs thermometer and intended freezer setting
- Monitoring 2 thermometers, visual inspection of 10 mL sucrose in HEPES solution as it thaws/refreezes

#### 7/23/2025: Freeze-thaw test in capillary, AFP Reading, resonator design manuscript figures
- semi-regular logging of freezer temperatures for determining freezer range of temperature oscillation
- Performed flash-freeze with freeze-thaw cycle of sucrose solution (no PVA) in an ESR capillary with Pravin
	- Observed ice "needle" formation and recrystallization, alos able to see ice-water equilibrium at the start of ice nucleation

#### 7/24/2025:
